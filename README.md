This is the first project for The Odin Project

Like many others, this is where it all begins along with the courses from freeCodeCamp

Once I'm done with this project I'll write my thoughts here:
It was easy and very fun to learn how to link HTMLs and start creating stuff within my dev enviroment, TOP is great!
